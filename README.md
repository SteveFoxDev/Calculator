JavaScript calculator

## About

I built this calculator app when I first learned javascript as a challenge to myself. Prior to this many of my projects were follow along projects, so I decided to challenge myself to build something without following along.  The app works well, the code is a bit clunky but I refuse to touch it. I want to keep it as is as a reminder to myself of where I started.
